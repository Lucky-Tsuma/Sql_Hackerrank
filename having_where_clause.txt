The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause cannot be used with aggregates(max, min,count,avg,sum), but the having clause can.

WHERE clause implements in row operations while HAVING clause implements in column operations.

WHERE clause can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements while HAVING clause can only be used with SELECT statement.
